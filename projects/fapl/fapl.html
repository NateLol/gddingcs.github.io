<p>Vision-based person re-identification aims to match a personâ€™s identity across multiple images, which is a fundamental task in multimedia content analysis and retrieval. Deep neural networks have recently manifested great potential in this task. However, a major bottleneck of existing supervised deep networks is their reliance on large amount of annotated training data. Manual labeling for person identities in large-scale surveillance camera systems is quite challenging and incurs significant costs. Some recent studies adopt generative model outputs as training data augmentation.</p>
<p>To more effectively use this synthetic data for an improved feature learning and re-identification performance, this work proposes a novel Feature Affinity-based Pseudo Labeling (FAPL) method with two possible label encodings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that employs pseudo-labeling by measuring the affinity of unlabeled samples with the under- lying clusters of labeled data samples using the intermediate feature representations from deep networks. We propose to train the network with the joint supervision of cross-entropy loss together with a center regularization term, which not only ensures discriminative feature representation learning but also simultaneously predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. We show that both label encodings can be learned in a unified manner and help improve the overall performance. Our extensive exper- iments on three person re-identification datasets, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, demonstrate significant per- formance boost over the state-of-the-art person re-identification approaches.</p>
